How to use?

It's very simple, clone this git repository in any IDE (VSCode, Sublime Text) using
`code`
git clone https://github.com/sona444/Basic-Python.git
`code`

Once you have it, just simply run through the notebook and add the code wherever it is needed. 
It starts from very beginning, print('hello world') and goes through python data structures, basic file operations, exception handling and basic classes.
If you already know any of these topics feel free to switch to the other sheet. We have an index in the beginning. :)
